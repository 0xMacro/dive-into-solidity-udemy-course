- Add a public state variable of type address called `owner`
- Declare the `constructor` and initialize all the state variables in the constructor. The `owner` should be initialized with the address of the account that deploys the contract
- Modify the `changeTokens()` function in such a way that it changes the state variable called tokens.
- Make it so that the contract can receive ETH by sending it directly to the contract address
- Add a function called `getBalance()` that returns the contract's balance
- Add a function called `transferAll()` that takes an argument of type `address` and transfers the entire balance of the contract to it
- Add a restriction so that only the `owner` can call `transferAll()`, otherwise, make it revert with `"ONLY_OWNER"`
- Add a function called `start()` that adds the address of the account that calls it to the dynamic array called `players`
- Declare a function called `concatenate` that takes two strings as parameters and returns them concatenated
  - Note: Since Solidity does not offer a native way to concatenate strings use abi.encodePacked() to do that
